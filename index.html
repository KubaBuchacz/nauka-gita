            <p class="text-color">Hey, what's up?
                Not much
                How are you doing?
                I'm good
                That's good</p>
            <p class="text-color">I sip the liquor but it's much too harsh
                Chase me down chase me down make a stop
                I know she said that she fun with her own soul
                Unfortunately 'cause there's so much of the devil's first small joke</p>
            <p class="text-color">The thing is this so cold, but she made my brain stop now she's a sinful
                Well, I've been searching for something sweet
                That's cold in the summer and take away the sea
                Now, the miracle's too much to blame
                And I'm trying hard chasing all the other men where
                I'm just searching for classic and timeless
                Oh, hey there, I think I found it</p>
            <p class="text-color">She my cherry cola
                She gon' keep me sober
                Let me keep you closer
                Bum me like a soda
                Sweeter than the champagne
                Smoother than this cold drink
                Keep me from the chardonnay
                I'm just sipping one thing</p>
